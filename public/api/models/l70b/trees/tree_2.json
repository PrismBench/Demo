Input: s = \"Hello World\"  \n   Output: 3  \n   Explanation: The vowels in the string are 'e', 'o', and 'o'.\n\n2. Input: s = \"Programming in Python!\"  \n   Output: 6  \n   Explanation: The vowels in the string are 'o', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'o'.\n\n### Relevance to Loops and Functions: \nThis problem tests the understanding of loops and functions in programming. It requires the use of a loop to iterate through each character in the string and a condition to check if the character is a vowel. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of defining and calling functions effectively.",

Input: s = \"Hello World\"  \n   Output: 3  \n   Explanation: The vowels in the string are 'e', 'o', and 'o'.\n\n2. Input: s = \"Programming in Python!\"  \n   Output: 6  \n   Explanation: The vowels in the string are 'o', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'o'.\n\n### Relevance to Loops and Functions: \nThis problem tests the understanding of loops and functions in programming. It requires the use of a loop to iterate through each character in the string and a condition to check if the character is a vowel.

              "problem_statement": "## Fibonacci Sequence\nDifficulty: Very Easy\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In mathematical terms, the sequence is defined as follows:\n- F(0) = 0\n- F(1) = 1\n- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1\n\nYour task is to write a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Input: \n- n: An integer (0 <= n <= 30)\n\n### Output: \n- An integer representing the nth Fibonacci number.\n\n### Constraints: \n- 0 <= n <= 30\n\n### Examples: \n1. Input: n = 0  \n   Output: 0  \n   Explanation: The 0th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 0.\n\n2. Input: n = 5  \n   Output: 5  \n   Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence up to the 5th number is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, so the 5th number is 5.\n\n### Relevance to Loops and Dynamic Programming: \nThis problem introduces students to the Fibonacci sequence, which is a classic case for demonstrating both iterative loops and dynamic programming techniques. While a simple recursive solution can work, using loops or dynamic programming helps understand how to optimize performance by avoiding redundant calculations. This lays the groundwork for more complex dynamic programming problems in the future.",

          "## Sort Strings by Length\nDifficulty: Very Easy\n\nCreate a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list with the strings sorted by their lengths in non-decreasing order. If two strings have the same length, their relative order in the input list should be preserved.\n\nYou should define a function called `sort_strings_by_length(strings)` that takes a list of strings and returns a new list sorted by their lengths.\n\n### Input:\n- strings: A list of strings (1 <= len(strings) <= 100) where each string has a length of at least 1 character and at most 100 characters.\n\n### Output:\n- A list of strings sorted by their lengths.\n\n### Constraints:\n- Each string contains only printable ASCII characters.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: strings = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"kiwi\", \"grape\", \"fig\"]\n   Output: [\"fig\", \"kiwi\", \"apple\", \"grape\", \"banana\"]\n   Explanation: The lengths of the strings are [5, 6, 4, 5, 3]. The sorted order based on lengths is [\"fig\", \"kiwi\", \"apple\", \"grape\", \"banana\"].\n\n2. Input: strings = [\"a\", \"abc\", \"ab\", \"abcd\", \"ab\"]\n   Output: [\"a\", \"ab\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"abcd\"]\n   Explanation: The lengths of the strings are [1, 3, 2, 4, 2]. The sorted order based on lengths is [\"a\", \"ab\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"abcd\"].\n\n### Relevance to Functions and Sorting:\nThis problem tests the understanding of defining functions and applying sorting algorithms based on specific criteria (in this case, string length). It reinforces the concept of sorting collections of data and introduces the importance of maintaining order when elements are equal in key value (length). This exercise is great for beginners to practice basic string manipulation and sorting techniques.",
          "## Sort Numbers in Reverse Order\nDifficulty: Very Easy\n\nWrite a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the integers sorted in descending order. \n\nYou should define a function called `sort_numbers_descending(nums)` that takes a list of integers and returns a new list sorted in descending order.\n\n### Input:\n- nums: A list of integers (-100 <= nums[i] <= 100)\n\n### Output:\n- A list of integers sorted in descending order.\n\n### Constraints:\n- The length of nums can be at most 100 elements.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]\n   Output: [9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n   Explanation: The sorted order in descending order is [9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1].\n\n2. Input: nums = [-1, -5, 0, 2, 4]\n   Output: [4, 2, 0, -1, -5]\n   Explanation: The sorted order in descending order is [4, 2, 0, -1, -5].\n\n### Relevance to Functions and Sorting:\nThis problem assesses the ability to define functions and apply sorting techniques. It emphasizes the importance of sorting data structures, providing a straightforward exercise for beginners. The task of sorting in reverse order helps reinforce foundational concepts that are applicable in various programming scenarios.",

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. Specifically, the sequence is:\n\nF(0) = 0  \nF(1) = 1  \nF(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n >= 2\n\n### Input:\n- n: An integer (0 <= n <= 30)\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the nth Fibonacci number.\n\n### Constraints:\n- 0 <= n <= 30\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: n = 5  \n   Output: 5  \n   Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence up to n=5 is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5], so the 5th Fibonacci number is 5.\n\n2. Input: n = 10  \n   Output: 55  \n   Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence up to n=10 is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55], so the 10th Fibonacci number is 55.\n\n### Relevance to Algorithms and Functions:\nThis problem helps in understanding recursion and iterative approaches in algorithms. It also illustrates how to implement functions and the importance of base cases and recursive calls in function design. Additionally, it allows students to explore the efficiency of different methods for calculating Fibonacci numbers, such as using memoization or iterative solutions.",

However, for multiples of three the string \"Fizz\" should be added instead of the number, and for the multiples of five \"Buzz\".

Input: n = 5  \n   Output: 5  \n   Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence up to n=5 is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5], so the 5th Fibonacci number is 5.\n\n2. Input: n = 10  \n   Output: 55  \n   Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence up to n=10 is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55], so the 10th Fibonacci number is 55.\n\n### Relevance to Algorithms and Functions:\nThis problem helps in understanding recursion and iterative approaches in algorithms. It also illustrates how to implement functions and the importance of base cases and recursive calls in function design. Additionally, it allows students to explore the efficiency of different methods for calculating Fibonacci numbers, such as using memoization or iterative solutions.",

For example, the array `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated to become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`. You are also given an integer `target`. Write a function to determine if `target` is in `nums`.\n\nYou must implement a solution with `O(log n)` time complexity.\n\n### Input:\n- `nums`: An array of integers, where `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4` and `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`. The array contains no duplicates.\n- `target`: An integer, where `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`.\n\n### Output:\n- A boolean value indicating whether the `target` exists in the `nums` array.\n\n### Constraints:\n- The input array `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0`  \n   Output: `true`  \n   Explanation: The target 0 is present in the array.\n\n2. Input: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3`  \n   Output: `false`  \n   Explanation: The target 3 is not present in the array.\n\n### Relevance to Conditionals and Searching: \nThis problem tests the understanding of searching algorithms, specifically the binary search algorithm, applied in a rotated sorted array scenario. The use of conditionals is crucial here to determine which half of the array to search next based on the pivot position, demonstrating the effective use of conditions in algorithmic design.",

For example, the array `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated to become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`. You are also given an integer `target`. Write a function to determine if `target` is in `nums`.\n\nYou must implement a solution with `O(log n)` time complexity.\n\n### Input:\n- `nums`: An array of integers, where `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4` and `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`. The array contains no duplicates.\n- `target`: An integer, where `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`.\n\n### Output:\n- A boolean value indicating whether the `target` exists in the `nums` array.\n\n### Constraints:\n- The input array `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0`  \n   Output: `true`  \n   Explanation: The target 0 is present in the array.\n\n2.

Your task is to implement a recursive function that searches for the target in the array. If the target is found, return its index; otherwise, return -1. Additionally, ensure that your function handles cases where the input array is empty.\n\n### Input: \n- `arr`: A sorted array of integers (0 <= arr.length <= 100)\n- `target`: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9)\n\n### Output: \n- An integer representing the index of the target if found, or -1 if the target is not present in the array.\n\n### Constraints: \n- 0 <= arr.length <= 100\n- -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9\n- The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Examples: \n1. Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 3  \n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: The target 3 is found at index 2 of the array.\n\n2. Input: arr = [], target = 1  \n   Output: -1  \n   Explanation: The array is empty, so the target cannot be found.\n\n### Relevance to Recursion and Searching: \nThis problem tests the understanding of recursion and searching algorithms. It encourages students to implement a recursive approach to linear or binary search, reinforcing concepts of function calls and base cases. Additionally, it emphasizes error handling by requiring the function to manage and correctly respond to an empty array input.",

Additionally, ensure that your function handles cases where the input array is empty.\n\n### Input: \n- `arr`: A sorted array of integers (0 <= arr.length <= 100)\n- `target`: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9)\n\n### Output: \n- An integer representing the index of the target if found, or -1 if the target is not present in the array.\n\n### Constraints: \n- 0 <= arr.length <= 100\n- -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9\n- The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Examples: \n1. Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 3  \n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: The target 3 is found at index 2 of the array.\n\n2. Input: arr = [], target = 1  \n   Output: -1  \n   Explanation: The array is empty, so the target cannot be found.\n\n### Relevance to Recursion and Searching: \nThis problem tests the understanding of recursion and searching algorithms. It encourages students to implement a recursive approach to linear or binary search, reinforcing concepts of function calls and base cases. Additionally, it emphasizes error handling by requiring the function to manage and correctly respond to an empty array input.",

If `target` does not exist in the array, return -1.\n\nYou must write an algorithm with O(log n) time complexity.\n\n### Input:\n- nums: An array of integers (1 <= nums.length <= 10^5) where each integer is in the range of [-10^4, 10^4].\n- target: An integer (-10^4 <= target <= 10^4)\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the index of `target` in `nums`, or -1 if it is not found.\n\n### Constraints:\n- The array `nums` is guaranteed to be sorted and rotated.\n- Each element in `nums` is unique.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0  \n   Output: 4  \n   Explanation: The target 0 is found at index 4.\n\n2. Input: nums = [1], target = 0  \n   Output: -1  \n   Explanation: The target 0 is not found in the array.\n\n### Relevance to Searching and Sorting: \nThis problem requires understanding of binary search techniques and the ability to adapt them to work with rotated sorted arrays. It tests the ability to identify the pivot point of rotation and effectively narrow down the search space, which is a valuable skill in algorithm design and analysis."

Your goal is to find the index of the `target` in the array using a combination of advanced searching and sorting techniques. The array may contain duplicates and is initially unsorted. You must implement a function that first sorts the array and then searches for the target number. However, the sorting must be performed in such a way that it minimizes the time complexity of the subsequent search operation.\n\n### Input:\n- `nums`: An unsorted array of integers (1 <= nums.length <= 10^6)\n- `target`: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9)\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the index of the `target` in the sorted array. If the `target` is not found, return -1.\n\n### Constraints:\n- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^6\n- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9\n- The array may contain duplicate elements.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: `nums = [4, 2, 7, 1, 3], target = 3`  \n   Output: `2`  \n   Explanation: After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 7]`, and the index of `target` (3) is 2.\n\n2. Input: `nums = [5, 3, 5, 2, 8], target = 6`  \n   Output: `-1`  \n   Explanation: The sorted array is `[2, 3, 5, 5, 8]`, and since 6 is not in the array, the output is -1.\n\n### Relevance to Searching and Sorting Algorithms:\nThis problem tests the understanding of both sorting and searching algorithms while incorporating the complexities of handling large inputs and duplicate values. It challenges the coder to think critically about the efficiency of sorting algorithms and the impact on subsequent search operations, particularly in terms of time complexity. The problem highlights the importance of combining these two fundamental areas of computer science to solve complex problems efficiently.",

However, for multiples of three, it should append \"Fizz\" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, it should append \"Buzz\". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it should append \"FizzBuzz\".\n\n### Input:\n- n: An integer (1 <= n <= 100)\n\n### Output:\n- A list of strings representing the numbers from 1 to n, with appropriate substitutions.\n\n### Constraints:\n- 1 <= n <= 100\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: n = 15  \n   Output: [\"1\", \"2\", \"Fizz\", \"4\", \"Buzz\", \"Fizz\", \"7\", \"8\", \"Fizz\", \"Buzz\", \"11\", \"Fizz\", \"13\", \"14\", \"FizzBuzz\"]  \n   Explanation: The output substitutes \"Fizz\" for multiples of 3, \"Buzz\" for multiples of 5, and \"FizzBuzz\" for multiples of both.\n\n2.

Input: original_price = 50, discount_percentage = 0 Output: \"50.00\" \n   Explanation: A 0% discount means the final price remains 50.00.\n\n3. Input: original_price = 75, discount_percentage = 110 Output: \"Invalid input\" \n   Explanation: The discount percentage of 110 is not valid as it exceeds 100.\n\n4. Input: original_price = -10, discount_percentage = 25 Output: \"Invalid input\" \n   Explanation: The original price cannot be negative, leading to an invalid input.\n\n5. Input: original_price = \"fifty\", discount_percentage = 20 Output: \"Invalid input\" \n   Explanation: The original price is a string and not a valid number.\n\n6. Input: original_price = 100, discount_percentage = \"ten\" Output: \"Invalid input\" \n   Explanation: The discount percentage is a string and cannot be processed.\n\n### Relevance to Conditionals and Error Handling: \nThis problem tests the understanding of conditionals for applying discount logic and the importance of error handling to manage invalid inputs. It promotes the need for validating user inputs and ensuring proper data types are used in calculations, which is critical for developing robust applications."

Otherwise, return \"Duplicate elements found\".\n\n### Input:\n- numbers: A list of integers (1 <= numbers.length <= 100)\n\n### Output:\n- A string: either \"All elements are unique\" or \"Duplicate elements found\".\n\n### Constraints:\n- 1 <= numbers.length <= 100\n- -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \n   Output: \"All elements are unique\"  \n   Explanation: All numbers in the list are unique, so we return the corresponding message.\n\n2. Input: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]  \n   Output: \"Duplicate elements found\"  \n   Explanation: The number 2 appears twice in the list, indicating that there are duplicates.\n\n### Relevance to Algorithms and Searching: \nThis problem challenges students to identify uniqueness within a list, fostering an understanding of searching and conditional logic. It encourages the use of data structures such as sets for efficient checking of duplicates, enhancing problem-solving skills. The emphasis on error handling through clear return messages for different scenarios prepares students for more complex algorithmic problems in the future.",
          "## Find the First Positive Number\nDifficulty: Easy\nYou are given a list of integers. Your task is to find the first positive number in the list. If there are no positive numbers, return the string \"No positive number found\".\n\n### Input:\n- numbers: A list of integers (0 <= numbers.length <= 100)\n\n### Output:\n- Either an integer representing the first positive number in the list or the string \"No positive number found\" if there are no positive numbers.\n\n### Constraints:\n- 0 <= numbers.length <= 100\n- -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000 (if the list is not empty)\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: numbers = [-3, -1, 2, 0, 4]  \n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: The first positive number in the list is 2.\n\n2. Input: numbers = [-5, -10, -1]  \n   Output: \"No positive number found\"  \n   Explanation: There are no positive numbers in the list, so we return the corresponding message.\n\n### Relevance to Algorithms and Searching: \nThis problem allows students to practice searching through a list while reinforcing the use of conditionals to handle different outcomes. It emphasizes the importance of error handling by addressing scenarios where the expected result (a positive number) may not be present. This foundational problem helps students build their skills in iteration and logical reasoning, which are crucial for more advanced algorithmic challenges."

If all positive integers up to the maximum value in the array are present, return the next positive integer which is one greater than the maximum value found in the array.\n\n### Input:\n- nums: An array of integers (1 <= nums.length <= 10^4)\n  \n### Output:\n- An integer representing the first missing positive integer.\n\n### Constraints:\n- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: nums = [3, 4, -1, 1]  \n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: The positive integers present are 1, 3, and 4. The smallest missing positive integer is 2.\n\n2. Input: nums = [1, 2, 0]  \n   Output: 3  \n   Explanation: The positive integers present are 1 and 2. The smallest missing positive integer is 3.\n\n### Relevance to Algorithms and Search Techniques: \nThis problem tests the understanding of searching for a specific condition in an array and the implementation of conditionals to handle different cases. It encourages students to think critically about how to optimize their search for the missing positive integer without the need for additional space, demonstrating the importance of efficient algorithm design. \n\nBy tackling this problem, students practice using appropriate loops and conditionals to navigate through the array effectively, laying the groundwork for more complex searching algorithms in the future.",

The function should return a dictionary where each key is the type of animal ('mammal', 'bird', 'reptile', 'insect'), and the value is a list of animal names that belong to that type.\n\n### Input:\n- animals: A list of tuples where each tuple consists of two elements:\n  - A string representing the name of the animal (1 <= len(animal name) <= 100).\n  - An integer representing the number of legs the animal has (0 <= number of legs <= 8).\n\n### Output:\n- A dictionary with the following keys: 'mammal', 'bird', 'reptile', 'insect'. The values are lists of strings containing the names of the corresponding animals.\n\n### Constraints:\n- The input list (animals) will contain between 1 and 1000 tuples.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: animals = [('dog', 4), ('cat', 4), ('sparrow', 2), ('lizard', 4), ('ant', 6)]\n   Output: {'mammal': ['dog', 'cat'], 'bird': ['sparrow'], 'reptile': ['lizard'], 'insect': ['ant']}\n   Explanation: The dog and cat are mammals, the sparrow is a bird, the lizard is a reptile, and the ant is an insect.\n\n2. Input: animals = [('fly', 6), ('snake', 0), ('eagle', 2), ('antelope', 4)]\n   Output: {'mammal': ['antelope'], 'bird': ['eagle'], 'reptile': ['snake'], 'insect': ['fly']}\n   Explanation: The antelope is a mammal, the eagle is a bird, the snake is a reptile, and the fly is an insect.\n\n### Relevance to Conditionals and Data Structures:\nThis problem tests the understanding of conditionals for categorizing animals based on their properties and the use of dictionaries to group data effectively. Students will practice using conditional statements to classify items and will also reinforce their knowledge of data structures by utilizing lists and dictionaries to organize and store information.",

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n### Input: \n- `s`: A string of lowercase English letters (1 <= s.length <= 10^4).\n- `p`: A string of lowercase English letters (1 <= p.length <= 100).\n\n### Output: \n- A list of integers representing the starting indices of the anagrams of `p` in `s`.\n\n### Constraints: \n- The solution must account for overlapping indices and ensure each valid index is returned.\n\n### Examples: \n1. Input: `s = \"cbaebabacd\", p = \"abc\"`  \n   Output: `[0, 6]`  \n   Explanation: The substrings \"cba\" (starting at index 0) and \"bac\" (starting at index 6) are anagrams of \"abc\".\n\n2.

          "## Word Search II\nDifficulty: Medium\nGiven a 2D board of characters and a list of words, return all words in the list that can be found in the board. The words can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where \"adjacent\" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.\n\n### Input:\n- board: A 2D list of characters representing the board (1 <= board.length <= 12, 1 <= board[0].length <= 12)\n- words: A list of strings, where each string represents a word to search for (1 <= words.length <= 10^3, 1 <= words[i].length <= 10)\n\n### Output:\n- A list of strings representing the words found in the board.\n\n### Constraints:\n- Each word in the list of words contains only lowercase letters.\n- The board may contain repeated letters.\n- All characters in the board are lowercase letters.\n\n### Examples:\n1.

The words \"pea\" and \"rain\" cannot be formed.\n\n2. Input: \n   board = [\n      ['a','b'],\n      ['c','d']\n   ], \n   words = [\"abcced\",\"see\",\"ab\",\"cad\"]\n   Output: [\"abcced\",\"cad\"]\n   Explanation: The word \"abcced\" can be found starting at (0,0) to (0,1) to (1,1) to (1,0) in the board, and \"cad\" can also be formed. \"see\" cannot be formed, and \"ab\" can be formed.\n\n### Relevance to Recursion and Searching: \nThis problem tests knowledge of recursion to navigate the board and search for words, emphasizing the need to implement backtracking effectively. It also requires understanding loops to traverse the board and manage the state during the search process. This challenge is common in algorithm interviews, particularly those focused on string manipulation and graph traversal.",

The words can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where \"adjacent\" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.\n\n### Input:\n- board: A 2D list of characters representing the board (1 <= board.length <= 12, 1 <= board[0].length <= 12)\n- words: A list of strings, where each string represents a word to search for (1 <= words.length <= 10^3, 1 <= words[i].length <= 10)\n\n### Output:\n- A list of strings representing the words found in the board.\n\n### Constraints:\n- Each word in the list of words contains only lowercase letters.\n- The board may contain repeated letters.\n- All characters in the board are lowercase letters.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: \n   board = [\n      ['o','a','a','n'],\n      ['e','t','a','e'],\n      ['i','h','k','r'],\n      ['i','f','l','v']\n   ], \n   words = [\"oath\",\"pea\",\"eat\",\"rain\"]\n   Output: [\"eat\",\"oath\"]\n   Explanation: The word \"eat\" can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, and the word \"oath\" can also be constructed. The words \"pea\" and \"rain\" cannot be formed.\n\n2. Input: \n   board = [\n      ['a','b'],\n      ['c','d']\n   ], \n   words = [\"abcced\",\"see\",\"ab\",\"cad\"]\n   Output: [\"abcced\",\"cad\"]\n   Explanation: The word \"abcced\" can be found starting at (0,0) to (0,1) to (1,1) to (1,0) in the board, and \"cad\" can also be formed. \"see\" cannot be formed, and \"ab\" can be formed.\n\n### Relevance to Recursion and Searching: \nThis problem tests knowledge of recursion to navigate the board and search for words, emphasizing the need to implement backtracking effectively. It also requires understanding loops to traverse the board and manage the state during the search process.

Additionally, if the input is invalid (not an array or contains non-integer values), the function should return \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Input:\n- arr: A sorted array of integers (0 <= arr.length <= 10^4). The array is sorted in ascending order.\n- target: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9).\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the sum of all elements in the array that are less than the target, or 0 if there are no such elements.\n- If the array is empty, return \"Empty array\".\n- If the input is invalid, return the string \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Constraints:\n- The input array can be empty.\n- The function should handle cases where the input is not an array or contains non-integer values.\n\n### Examples:\n1.

Input: arr = [], target = 5\n   Output: \"Empty array\"\n   Explanation: The input array is empty.\n\n4. Input: arr = [1, 2, \"three\", 4], target = 3\n   Output: \"Invalid input\"\n   Explanation: The input contains a non-integer value, which is not allowed.\n\n### Relevance to Recursion and Searching:\nThis problem tests the understanding of recursion and how to traverse a sorted array to accumulate a result based on conditions. It also emphasizes the importance of handling edge cases such as empty arrays and invalid inputs, which is crucial for writing robust code. This problem helps students practice implementing recursive logic while understanding the flow of data through the stack and developing a keen awareness of input validation."

          "## Fruit Basket\nDifficulty: Easy\nYou are tasked with creating a function that determines the total number of fruits in a basket based on the type of fruits and their respective quantities. The basket can contain multiple types of fruits, and each type has a specified quantity. Your goal is to return the total count of fruits in the basket.\n\n### Input: \n- `fruits`: A dictionary where the keys are strings representing fruit names and the values are integers representing the quantities of each fruit. (1 <= len(fruits) <= 100)\n\n### Output: \n- An integer representing the total number of fruits in the basket.\n\n### Constraints:\n- Each fruit quantity is a non-negative integer (0 <= fruits[fruit_name] <= 1000)\n- The fruit names are unique and consist of lowercase alphabetic characters only.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: \n   ```python\n   fruits = {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 5}\n   ```\n   Output: `10`\n   Explanation: There are 3 apples, 2 bananas, and 5 oranges, totaling 10 fruits.\n\n2. Input: \n   ```python\n   fruits = {'grape': 0, 'kiwi': 4, 'mango': 1}\n   ```\n   Output: `5`\n   Explanation: There are 0 grapes, 4 kiwis, and 1 mango, totaling 5 fruits.\n\n### Relevance to Conditionals, Data Structures, and Functions: \nThis problem tests the understanding of basic data structures (dictionaries), conditional checks (to ensure quantities are non-negative), and the implementation of functions (to encapsulate the logic of counting fruits). It provides a simple yet effective way to practice using conditionals and iterating through data structures in Python."

The basket can contain multiple types of fruits, and each type has a specified quantity. Your goal is to return the total count of fruits in the basket.\n\n### Input: \n- `fruits`: A dictionary where the keys are strings representing fruit names and the values are integers representing the quantities of each fruit. (1 <= len(fruits) <= 100)\n\n### Output: \n- An integer representing the total number of fruits in the basket.\n\n### Constraints:\n- Each fruit quantity is a non-negative integer (0 <= fruits[fruit_name] <= 1000)\n- The fruit names are unique and consist of lowercase alphabetic characters only.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: \n   ```python\n   fruits = {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 5}\n   ```\n   Output: `10`\n   Explanation: There are 3 apples, 2 bananas, and 5 oranges, totaling 10 fruits.\n\n2. Input: \n   ```python\n   fruits = {'grape': 0, 'kiwi': 4, 'mango': 1}\n   ```\n   Output: `5`\n   Explanation: There are 0 grapes, 4 kiwis, and 1 mango, totaling 5 fruits.\n\n### Relevance to Conditionals, Data Structures, and Functions: \nThis problem tests the understanding of basic data structures (dictionaries), conditional checks (to ensure quantities are non-negative), and the implementation of functions (to encapsulate the logic of counting fruits).

The sequence is defined as follows:\n- F(0) = 0\n- F(1) = 1\n- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1\n\nYour task is to write a function that computes the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming. You can assume that n is a non-negative integer.\n\n### Input:\n- n: A non-negative integer (0 <= n <= 30)\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the nth Fibonacci number.\n\n### Constraints:\n- 0 <= n <= 30\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: n = 5  \n   Output: 5  \n   Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence up to n=5 is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5], and thus F(5) = 5.\n\n2. Input: n = 10  \n   Output: 55  \n   Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence up to n=10 is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55], and thus F(10) = 55.\n\n### Relevance to Functions and Dynamic Programming: \nThis problem tests a student's understanding of functions, conditionals, and the concept of dynamic programming. It encourages the use of memoization or tabulation to optimize the computation of Fibonacci numbers, demonstrating how to efficiently solve a problem that has overlapping subproblems.",

The jump is performed by taking the value at the current index as the number of steps to jump forward. If the jump goes beyond the last index, wrap around to the beginning of the array using modulo.\n\n### Input:\n- `nums`: An array of integers (1 <= nums.length <= 10^5) where each element is within the range [-10^9, 10^9].\n- `start`: An integer (0 <= start < nums.length) representing the starting index.\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the number of distinct indices visited.\n\n### Constraints:\n- Each element in `nums` can be negative or positive and dictates the jump size, which can lead to movement in either direction.\n- The array is circular; hence, jumps must wrap around.\n  \n### Examples:\n1. Input: `nums = [2, 3, 1, -4, -2], start = 0`  \n   Output: `5`  \n   Explanation: Starting at index 0, you can visit all indices: 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4, and then back to 0.\n  \n2. Input: `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1], start = 0`  \n   Output: `4`  \n   Explanation: Starting at index 0, you can visit all indices continuously since every jump goes to the next index.\n\n3. Input: `nums = [1, 2, -1, -4, 5], start = 0`  \n   Output: `3`  \n   Explanation: Starting at index 0, you visit indices 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0, thus visiting only 3 distinct indices: 0, 1, and 3.\n\n### Relevance to Loops, Searching, and Data Structures:\nThis problem tests the understanding of loops and efficient searching in a context requiring traversal of data structures.

The aim is to sort the integers under certain conditions and then perform a search operation that simulates error handling.\n\n### Problem Statement\nGiven an array of integers `arr`, your goal is to implement a function that:\n1. Sorts the array in ascending order, but with the following conditions:\n   - If an integer is even, it should be sorted in a descending order compared to other even integers.\n   - If an integer is odd, it should be sorted in ascending order compared to other odd integers.\n   \n2. After sorting, implement a search function that takes a target integer `target`:\n   - If the target is found in the array, return its index.\n   - If the target is not found, instead of returning -1, throw an error with the message \"Target not found!\".\n   \n### Input:\n- arr: An array of integers (1 <= arr.length <= 10^5, -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9)\n- target: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9)\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the index of the target in the sorted array or an error message if the target is not found.\n\n### Constraints:\n- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5\n- -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9\n- The solution should run in O(n log n) time complexity for sorting and O(n) for searching.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: arr = [3, 1, 4, 2, 8, 6, 7], target = 4\n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: The sorted array will be [3, 1, 7, 4, 6, 8, 2] (odds in ascending, evens in descending). The index of target 4 is 3.\n\n2. Input: arr = [10, 2, 5, 7, -1, -2], target = 5\n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: The sorted array will be [-1, -2, 5, 10, 2] (odds in ascending, evens in descending). The index of target 5 is 2.\n\n3. Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7], target = 10\n   Output: \"Target not found!\"  \n   Explanation: The target 10 is not in the array, so an error message is returned.\n\n### Relevance to Sorting, Searching, and Error Handling:\nThis problem tests the understanding of complex sorting techniques, including conditional sorting based on number parity. Additionally, it introduces error handling, requiring students to manage search outcomes with appropriate messaging instead of typical return values. This combines algorithmic efficiency and robust coding practices, essential for real-world applications.",

The aim is to sort the integers under certain conditions and then perform a search operation that simulates error handling.\n\n### Problem Statement\nGiven an array of integers `arr`, your goal is to implement a function that:\n1. Sorts the array in ascending order, but with the following conditions:\n   - If an integer is even, it should be sorted in a descending order compared to other even integers.\n   - If an integer is odd, it should be sorted in ascending order compared to other odd integers.\n   \n2. After sorting, implement a search function that takes a target integer `target`:\n   - If the target is found in the array, return its index.\n   - If the target is not found, instead of returning -1, throw an error with the message \"Target not found!\".\n   \n### Input:\n- arr: An array of integers (1 <= arr.length <= 10^5, -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9)\n- target: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9)\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the index of the target in the sorted array or an error message if the target is not found.\n\n### Constraints:\n- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5\n- -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9\n- The solution should run in O(n log n) time complexity for sorting and O(n) for searching.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: arr = [3, 1, 4, 2, 8, 6, 7], target = 4\n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: The sorted array will be [3, 1, 7, 4, 6, 8, 2] (odds in ascending, evens in descending). The index of target 4 is 3.\n\n2. Input: arr = [10, 2, 5, 7, -1, -2], target = 5\n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: The sorted array will be [-1, -2, 5, 10, 2] (odds in ascending, evens in descending). The index of target 5 is 2.\n\n3. Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7], target = 10\n   Output: \"Target not found!\"  \n   Explanation: The target 10 is not in the array, so an error message is returned.\n\n### Relevance to Sorting, Searching, and Error Handling:\nThis problem tests the understanding of complex sorting techniques, including conditional sorting based on number parity. Additionally, it introduces error handling, requiring students to manage search outcomes with appropriate messaging instead of typical return values. This combines algorithmic efficiency and robust coding practices, essential for real-world applications."

The aim is to sort the integers under certain conditions and then perform a search operation that simulates error handling.\n\n### Problem Statement\nGiven an array of integers `arr`, your goal is to implement a function that:\n1. Sorts the array in ascending order, but with the following conditions:\n   - If an integer is even, it should be sorted in a descending order compared to other even integers.\n   - If an integer is odd, it should be sorted in ascending order compared to other odd integers.\n   \n2. After sorting, implement a search function that takes a target integer `target`:\n   - If the target is found in the array, return its index.\n   - If the target is not found, instead of returning -1, throw an error with the message \"Target not found!\".\n   \n### Input:\n- arr: An array of integers (1 <= arr.length <= 10^5, -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9)\n- target: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9)\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the index of the target in the sorted array or an error message if the target is not found.\n\n### Constraints:\n- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5\n- -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9\n- The solution should run in O(n log n) time complexity for sorting and O(n) for searching.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: arr = [3, 1, 4, 2, 8, 6, 7], target = 4\n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: The sorted array will be [3, 1, 7, 4, 6, 8, 2] (odds in ascending, evens in descending). The index of target 4 is 3.\n\n2. Input: arr = [10, 2, 5, 7, -1, -2], target = 5\n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: The sorted array will be [-1, -2, 5, 10, 2] (odds in ascending, evens in descending). The index of target 5 is 2.\n\n3. Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7], target = 10\n   Output: \"Target not found!\"  \n   Explanation: The target 10 is not in the array, so an error message is returned.\n\n### Relevance to Sorting, Searching, and Error Handling:\nThis problem tests the understanding of complex sorting techniques, including conditional sorting based on number parity. Additionally, it introduces error handling, requiring students to manage search outcomes with appropriate messaging instead of typical return values. This combines algorithmic efficiency and robust coding practices, essential for real-world applications.",

Your goal is to create a function that sorts the valid integers in ascending order and then performs a binary search to find a specific target value. If the target is found, return its index; otherwise, return -1. The algorithm must handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate messages when encountering non-integer values.\n\n### Input:\n- nums: A list of elements (1 <= nums.length <= 10^6), where each element can be an integer or a non-integer (string, list, etc.).\n- target: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9)\n\n### Output:\n- If the list contains valid integers only, return the index of the target in the sorted list. If the target is not found, return -1.\n- If the list contains non-integer values, return a string indicating an error message: \"Invalid input: non-integer values present.\"\n\n### Constraints:\n- The list may contain a mix of valid integers and invalid types.\n- You must sort the valid integers and execute a binary search on the sorted list.\n- Your solution should have a time complexity of O(n log n) for sorting and O(log n) for searching.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: nums = [3, 1, 4, 'a', 2], target = 2  \n   Output: \"Invalid input: non-integer values present.\"  \n   Explanation: The list contains a non-integer value ('a'), so an error message is returned.\n\n2. Input: nums = [5, 3, 7, 1, 4], target = 4  \n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: After sorting the list to [1, 3, 4, 5, 7], the target value 4 is found at index 2.\n\n3. Input: nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], target = 25  \n   Output: -1  \n   Explanation: The list is sorted as is, and since 25 is not present, -1 is returned.\n\n### Relevance to Sorting, Searching, and Error Handling: \nThis problem challenges the understanding of sorting algorithms with a focus on error handling, as the presence of non-integer elements requires conditional checks and proper error messages. Additionally, it tests the ability to implement a binary search on a sorted array, reinforcing the concepts of algorithm efficiency and robustness in coding practices.",

              "problem_statement": "## Search and Sort with Error Handling\nDifficulty: Very Hard\nYou are tasked with implementing a search algorithm on a list of integers that may contain erroneous values (non-integer elements). Your goal is to create a function that sorts the valid integers in ascending order and then performs a binary search to find a specific target value. If the target is found, return its index; otherwise, return -1. The algorithm must handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate messages when encountering non-integer values.\n\n### Input:\n- nums: A list of elements (1 <= nums.length <= 10^6), where each element can be an integer or a non-integer (string, list, etc.).\n- target: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9)\n\n### Output:\n- If the list contains valid integers only, return the index of the target in the sorted list. If the target is not found, return -1.\n- If the list contains non-integer values, return a string indicating an error message: \"Invalid input: non-integer values present.\"\n\n### Constraints:\n- The list may contain a mix of valid integers and invalid types.\n- You must sort the valid integers and execute a binary search on the sorted list.\n- Your solution should have a time complexity of O(n log n) for sorting and O(log n) for searching.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: nums = [3, 1, 4, 'a', 2], target = 2  \n   Output: \"Invalid input: non-integer values present.\"  \n   Explanation: The list contains a non-integer value ('a'), so an error message is returned.\n\n2. Input: nums = [5, 3, 7, 1, 4], target = 4  \n   Output: 2  \n   Explanation: After sorting the list to [1, 3, 4, 5, 7], the target value 4 is found at index 2.\n\n3. Input: nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], target = 25  \n   Output: -1  \n   Explanation: The list is sorted as is, and since 25 is not present, -1 is returned.\n\n### Relevance to Sorting, Searching, and Error Handling: \nThis problem challenges the understanding of sorting algorithms with a focus on error handling, as the presence of non-integer elements requires conditional checks and proper error messages. Additionally, it tests the ability to implement a binary search on a sorted array, reinforcing the concepts of algorithm efficiency and robustness in coding practices.",

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where \"adjacent\" cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word. \n\n### Input: \n- board: A 2D list of characters (1 <= m, n <= 12)\n- words: A list of strings (1 <= words.length <= 10^4, 1 <= words[i].length <= 10)\n\n### Output:\n- A list of strings containing all words from the input list that can be found on the board.\n\n### Constraints: \n- The board consists of lowercase English letters.\n- Each word in the input list contains only lowercase English letters and does not exceed 10 characters in length.\n- The number of unique characters in the board can be at most 26.\n\n### Examples: \n1. Input: \n   board = [\n     ['o','a','a','n'],\n     ['e','t','a','e'],\n     ['i','h','k','r'],\n     ['i','f','l','v']\n   ],\n   words = [\"oath\",\"pea\",\"eat\",\"rain\"]\n   \n   Output: [\"eat\",\"oath\"]\n   \n   Explanation: \"eat\" and \"oath\" can be constructed from the board.\n\n2.

The recursive function simulates the branching that occurs as the algorithm explores potential word formations, while loops are used for managing traversal through the board and the list of words. The problem challenges students to apply search algorithms effectively within a constrained environment, making it a staple in understanding backtracking techniques in problem-solving.",

However, the function must handle certain constraints: if the substring to be replaced is empty, or if the replacement string is longer than the original string, the function should return an error message.\n\n### Input:\n- `text`: A string (1 <= text.length <= 10^5) that may contain special characters and spaces.\n- `old_substring`: A string (0 <= old_substring.length <= 100) that needs to be replaced.\n- `new_substring`: A string (0 <= new_substring.length <= 100) that will replace the old substring.\n\n### Output:\n- A string that is the modified version of `text` with all occurrences of `old_substring` replaced by `new_substring`. If there is an error, return the string \"Error: Invalid input\".\n\n### Constraints:\n- The `old_substring` cannot be empty.\n- The `new_substring` cannot be longer than the original `text`.\n- The function should be case-sensitive, meaning \"abc\" and \"ABC\" should be treated differently.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: text = \"Hello world\", old_substring = \"world\", new_substring = \"there\"  \n   Output: \"Hello there\"  \n   Explanation: The word \"world\" is replaced by \"there\".\n\n2.

Input: nums = [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n   Output: 3\n   Explanation: The sorted list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The unique integers are [1, 2, 3], hence the count is 3.\n\n2. Input: nums = [5, 5, 5, 5]\n   Output: 1\n   Explanation: The sorted list is [5, 5, 5, 5]. The only unique integer is [5], hence the count is 1.\n\n### Relevance to Loops, Sorting, and Data Structures:\nThis problem tests the understanding of basic loops for counting and sorting operations. It encourages the use of sorting algorithms and demonstrates how to identify unique elements in a list, which is a fundamental concept in data structures and algorithms.

If two strings have the same length, their relative order in the input list should be preserved.\n\nYou should define a function called `sort_strings_by_length(strings)` that takes a list of strings and returns a new list sorted by their lengths.\n\n### Input:\n- strings: A list of strings (1 <= len(strings) <= 100) where each string has a length of at least 1 character and at most 100 characters.\n\n### Output:\n- A list of strings sorted by their lengths.\n\n### Constraints:\n- Each string contains only printable ASCII characters.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: strings = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"kiwi\", \"grape\", \"fig\"]\n   Output: [\"fig\", \"kiwi\", \"apple\", \"grape\", \"banana\"]\n   Explanation: The lengths of the strings are [5, 6, 4, 5, 3]. The sorted order based on lengths is [\"fig\", \"kiwi\", \"apple\", \"grape\", \"banana\"].\n\n2.

The sorted order based on lengths is [\"a\", \"ab\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"abcd\"].\n\n### Relevance to Functions and Sorting:\nThis problem tests the understanding of defining functions and applying sorting algorithms based on specific criteria (in this case, string length). It reinforces the concept of sorting collections of data and introduces the importance of maintaining order when elements are equal in key value (length).

The program should take an age input and return a string that specifies the category of the age according to the following criteria:\n\n- \"Child\" for ages 0 to 12\n- \"Teenager\" for ages 13 to 19\n- \"Adult\" for ages 20 to 64\n- \"Senior\" for ages 65 and above\n\nIf the input is not a number or is a negative value, the program should return \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Input:\n- age: A value that can be an integer, float, or any other type (e.g., string, None).\n\n### Output:\n- A string representing the age category or \"Invalid input\" if the input does not qualify as a valid non-negative numerical age.\n\n### Constraints:\n- The age can be any numerical value including negative numbers.\n- The input can also be of any other type, including but not limited to strings, lists, and None.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: age = 10 Output: \"Child\" \n   Explanation: The age of 10 falls under the \"Child\" category.\n\n2. Input: age = 15 Output: \"Teenager\" \n   Explanation: The age of 15 is classified as \"Teenager\".\n\n3. Input: age = 30 Output: \"Adult\" \n   Explanation: The age of 30 is classified as \"Adult\".\n\n4. Input: age = 70 Output: \"Senior\" \n   Explanation: The age of 70 falls under the \"Senior\" category.\n\n5. Input: age = \"twenty\" Output: \"Invalid input\" \n   Explanation: The input is a string and not a valid number.\n\n6. Input: age = -5 Output: \"Invalid input\" \n   Explanation: The age cannot be negative, resulting in an invalid input.\n\n### Relevance to Conditionals and Error Handling: \nThis problem highlights the use of conditionals to classify ages into distinct categories and the importance of error handling to manage different types of input. It reinforces the concept of validating user input and ensuring that the program behaves correctly in the face of unexpected data, which is crucial for robust programming.",

Your task is to implement a recursive function that searches for the target in the array. If the target exists, return its index; otherwise, return -1. Additionally, the function should handle any errors that may arise from invalid input types by returning \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Input:\n- arr: A sorted array of integers (0 <= arr.length <= 10^4). The array is sorted in ascending order.\n- target: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9).\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the index of the target in the array, or -1 if the target is not found. \n- If the input is invalid, return the string \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Constraints:\n- The input array can be empty.\n- The function should handle cases where the input is not an array or if the target is not an integer.\n\n### Examples: \n1. Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 3\n   Output: 2\n   Explanation: The target 3 is located at index 2 in the array.\n\n2. Input: arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], target = 25\n   Output: -1\n   Explanation: The target 25 is not found in the array.\n\n3. Input: arr = \"not an array\", target = 3\n   Output: \"Invalid input\"\n   Explanation: The input provided for arr is not an array.\n\n### Relevance to Recursion and Searching: \nThis problem tests the understanding of recursive search algorithms, specifically binary search since the array is sorted. It also incorporates error handling to ensure that the function can manage invalid input gracefully, which is an important aspect of robust programming. The problem encourages students to think critically about input validation while implementing a fundamental searching technique.",

If the array is empty, your function should return \"Empty array\". Additionally, if the input is invalid (not an array or contains non-integer values), it should return \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Input:\n- arr: A sorted array of integers (0 <= arr.length <= 10^4). The array may have duplicates and is sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the maximum value in the array, or \"Empty array\" if the array is empty.\n- If the input is invalid, return the string \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Constraints:\n- The input array can be empty.\n- The function should handle cases where the input is not an array or contains non-integer values.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n   Output: 5\n   Explanation: The maximum value in the array is 5.\n\n2. Input: arr = [10, 20, 30, 30, 30, 40]\n   Output: 40\n   Explanation: The maximum value in the array is 40.\n\n3.

Input: arr = [1, 2, \"three\", 4]\n   Output: \"Invalid input\"\n   Explanation: The input contains a non-integer value, which is not allowed.\n\n### Relevance to Recursion and Searching:\nThis problem tests the understanding of recursive functions and their application in searching through a data structure. Although finding the maximum can also be done iteratively, this exercise emphasizes recursion as a means to solve a simple problem and involves error handling to ensure that the function behaves correctly with various types of invalid input. This encourages students to think critically about input validation and the robustness of their code.",

              "problem_statement": "## Recursive Count Occurrences\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nYou are given a sorted array of integers and a target integer. Your task is to implement a recursive function that counts the number of occurrences of the target in the array. If the array is empty, return \"Empty array\". Additionally, if the input is invalid (not an array or contains non-integer values), the function should return \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Input:\n- arr: A sorted array of integers (0 <= arr.length <= 10^4). The array is sorted in ascending order and may contain duplicates.\n- target: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9).\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the count of occurrences of the target in the array, or \"Empty array\" if the array is empty.\n- If the input is invalid, return the string \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Constraints:\n- The input array can be empty.\n- The function should handle cases where the input is not an array or contains non-integer values.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4], target = 2\n   Output: 3\n   Explanation: The target 2 occurs 3 times in the array.\n\n2. Input: arr = [4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6], target = 6\n   Output: 1\n   Explanation: The target 6 occurs 1 time in the array.\n\n3. Input: arr = [], target = 3\n   Output: \"Empty array\"\n   Explanation: The input array is empty.\n\n4. Input: arr = [1, 2, \"three\", 4], target = 2\n   Output: \"Invalid input\"\n   Explanation: The input contains a non-integer value, which is not allowed.\n\n### Relevance to Recursion and Searching:\nThis problem tests the understanding of recursion and searching techniques in a sorted array context. It encourages students to employ a recursive approach to count occurrences, which requires understanding of both recursion and base conditions. Additionally, it incorporates error handling, reinforcing the importance of validating input for robust programming. This problem provides a practical scenario where recursion can simplify the counting process while navigating through the array elements.",

If the array is empty, return \"Empty array\". Additionally, if the input is invalid (not an array or contains non-integer values), the function should return \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Input:\n- arr: A sorted array of integers (0 <= arr.length <= 10^4). The array is sorted in ascending order and may contain duplicates.\n- target: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9).\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the index of the first occurrence of the target in the array, or -1 if the target is not found.\n- If the array is empty, return \"Empty array\".\n- If the input is invalid, return the string \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Constraints:\n- The input array can be empty.\n- The function should handle cases where the input is not an array or contains non-integer values.\n\n### Examples:\n1.

              "problem_statement": "## Recursive Sum of Target in Sorted Array\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nYou are given a sorted array of integers and a target integer. Your task is to implement a recursive function that calculates the sum of all elements in the array that are less than the target. If the array is empty, return \"Empty array\". Additionally, if the input is invalid (not an array or contains non-integer values), the function should return \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Input:\n- arr: A sorted array of integers (0 <= arr.length <= 10^4). The array is sorted in ascending order.\n- target: An integer (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9).\n\n### Output:\n- An integer representing the sum of all elements in the array that are less than the target, or 0 if there are no such elements.\n- If the array is empty, return \"Empty array\".\n- If the input is invalid, return the string \"Invalid input\".\n\n### Constraints:\n- The input array can be empty.\n- The function should handle cases where the input is not an array or contains non-integer values.\n\n### Examples:\n1. Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 4\n   Output: 6\n   Explanation: The sum of elements less than the target (1 + 2 + 3) is 6.\n\n2. Input: arr = [10, 20, 30, 40], target = 25\n   Output: 30\n   Explanation: The sum of elements less than the target (10 + 20) is 30.\n\n3. Input: arr = [], target = 5\n   Output: \"Empty array\"\n   Explanation: The input array is empty.\n\n4. Input: arr = [1, 2, \"three\", 4], target = 3\n   Output: \"Invalid input\"\n   Explanation: The input contains a non-integer value, which is not allowed.\n\n### Relevance to Recursion and Searching:\nThis problem tests the understanding of recursion and how to traverse a sorted array to accumulate a result based on conditions. It also emphasizes the importance of handling edge cases such as empty arrays and invalid inputs, which is crucial for writing robust code. This problem helps students practice implementing recursive logic while understanding the flow of data through the stack and developing a keen awareness of input validation.",
